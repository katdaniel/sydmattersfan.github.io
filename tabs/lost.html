				<pre>[Verse 1]

C#m                                    D
A tree I was, she had a lighter in the hand
Bm             C#                F#m    E
Boys they burn brighter in their twenties
         Amaj7                           Dmaj7
With the years I hope she tries to understand
    Dmaj7/C#      Dmaj7          Bm
Ooh-Ooooh     Ooh-Ooooh...
Bm         E          A F#m   Bm
Hmmmmm...  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

[Verse 2]
C#m                                    D
B a good kid you shut up and watch the show
    Bm        C#      F#m    E
The teacher's choir almighty
   Amaj7                                   Dmaj7
It sings to you all the things you need to know
    Dmaj7/C#      Dmaj7          Bm
Ooh-Ooooh     Ooh-Ooooh I wasn't ready
Bm         E          A F#m   Bm
Hmmmmm...  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

[Verse 3]
C#m                               D
C the sharks controlling the undertow
    Bm         C#        F#m  E
And making the waves I'm riding
          Amaj7                            Dmaj7
I've been thinking about my life above the law
    Dmaj7/C#      Dmaj7          Bm
Ooh-Ooooh     Ooh-Ooooh the consequences

[Pre-Chorus]
Bm         E          A F#m   Bm
They had a power over me
Bm         E          A F#m   Bm
They had a power over me

[Bridge]
    A               C#m
Aah-Aaaah...    Aah-Aaaah...
    A               C#m
Aah-Aaaah...    Aah-Aaaah...
    A               C#m
Aah-Aaaah...    Aah-Aaaah...
    A               C#m
Aah-Aaaah...

[Chorus 1]
C#m
I'm not sure if I get it right
       E                       C7
Was it something I said was it something I tried
    A                        D         G        Bm
I'm beginning to believe you started a fight on purpose
       E       F#m           E7   A
What a strange feeling to be alone

[Chorus 2]
C#m
I'm not here to get it wrong
      E                      C7
Is it something I want is it something I don't
    A                       D        G        Bm
I'm beginning to forget our starting point on purpose
       E       F#m           E7  A
What a strange feeling to be lost

[Chorus 3]
C#m
I'm not sure if I get it right
       E                       C7
Was it something I said was it something I tried
    A                        D         G        Bm
I'm beginning to believe you started a fight on purpose
       E       F#m           Bm
What a strange feeling to be lost

[Outro]
E   F#m   Bm [4x]

[Ending]
E   A</pre>
