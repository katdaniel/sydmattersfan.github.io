				<pre>[Verse]

F         C      Gm            A
She’s been dancing in a topless bar
Dm            C       F
And she doing well so far
F     C          Gm               A
She is working to earn her own dollar
Dm               C              Gm           A
‘Coz the fortune teller didn’t talk about stars

[Chorus]

Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes
Bb             A
A mind full of vintage squibs
Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes
Bb             A
A mind full of cheering lives

[Verse]

F         C
She needs something
   Gm                    A
To keep her feet on the ground
Dm                       C
‘Coz when she’s flying around
          Gm                  A
She never wants to come back down

[Bridge]

F       C        Gm     A
She lost her smile in ’95
Dm              C                Gm                A
When she woke up on the back seat of a stunted car

[Chorus]

Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes
Bb             A
A mind full of vintage squibs
Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes
Bb             A
A mind full of cheering lives

[Bridge]

F       C       Gm    A
'think I lost her at 24
Dm               C                   Gm                    A
When she started to lock herself up behind the bathroom door

[Chorus 2]

Dm      C            F
All along the white line
Bb             A
She can travel back in time
Dm      C            F
All along the white line
Bb             A
...

[Chorus 2]

Dm      C            F
All along the white line
        Bb             A
She can travel back in time
Dm      C            F
All along the white line
        Bb             A
...

[Verse 4]

F         C      Gm            A
I’m on my way looking up today
Dm               C
Never mind if it could be worth it
Gm           A
Tuesday flies away </pre>
