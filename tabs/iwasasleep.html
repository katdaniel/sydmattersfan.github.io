				<pre>[Intro]
A Am

[Verse]
A                            Am
I walk up on a cold basement ground
Em                   Dm
Ghost days leave me alone,
           F                    C
You're not part of the medicine plan

[Pre-chorus]
               Em        E7
They said it's hard to explain
         Dm             F
And it's harder to understand
           G           E7
I said whatever happen then
       C
I was asleep

[Chorus]
Em                    E7
I was walking in the park
    Dm                            F
When all the streets lights went out
    G           E7
And all looks so down

[Instrumental]
A Am A Am
Em Dm F C
A Am
Em Dm F C

[Verse]
A                               Am
I freaked out on the cold up to couch
Em               Dm
Visioners on the run
F                 C
Telling me not to scream

[Pre-chorus]
                Em     E7
They said "it's bad to complain
     Dm                    F
When all the city burns in vain"
               G          E7
They said whatever happen then
       C
I was asleep

[Chorus]
Em                    E7
I was walking in the park
    Dm                            F
When all the streets lights went out
    G           E7      Am
And all looks so down Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Em                    E7
I was walking in the park
    Dm                            F
When all the streets lights went out
    G           E7
And all looks so down</pre>
