				<h3>Someday Sometimes</h3>
				<p>Tuning: Standard</p>
				<p>Capo: 0</p>
				<pre>[Verse 1]
Bm             F#m
I wish I could see you in the dark
D Am E F D
Bm                  F#m
Some of us blow but some of us softly spark
D Am E F D
Bm                        F#m
Some of them told me they saw you shining bright
D Am E F D
Am E F D (x4)


[Chorus]
                    G
To me it doesn't matter
                            C
If you're empty on the week end
          Am                        D
If you're waiting for the summer to end and start again
              G                                C
It doesn't matter if you're writing foolish letters
                     Am
If you put them in a bottle
                        D
If you're waiting for a dreamer
                      G
To answer through the water

G Em G Em C Am F D


[Verse 2]

Bm             F#m
I wish I could see you in the dark

Bm F#m D
Am E F D (x4)


[Chorus]
                    G
To me it doesn't matter
                            C
If you're empty on the week end
          Am                        D
If you're waiting for the summer to end and start again
              G                                C
It doesn't matter if you're writing foolish letters
                     Am
If you put them in a bottle
                        D
If you're waiting for a dreamer
                      G
To answer through the water

G Em G Em C Am F D


[Bridge]
G           Em
Soon someday
G            Em
Give it all away
         C              Am
All with nothing to say
       F            D
And no reason to stay

G               Em
Life's too tough
    G           Em
And love's not enough
           C                Am
To make me stop thinking of
          F            D
What it's like up above
G
Yeah</pre>
