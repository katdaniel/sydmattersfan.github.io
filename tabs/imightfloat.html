[Intro]
Am  G C F C (C/B)
Am  G C F C (C/B)
Am  G C F C (C/B)


[Verse]
Am
There is something in the weather coming
          G                       C                     F                  C         (C/B)
It's the spring time floating on, upon the city I won't blow it but (won't blow it but)
Am
 I will leave this town by the weekend if you
G                       C
 Buy me a ticket out to save my money for
    F                           C
the dark days (..money for the dark)
Am                                        G
 I will travel through the seas until the summer voices of
   C
the fire noises of
    F                       C
the burning witches call me home
Am                                             G
 And I will find the strength to give up all the things I'm made up of
     C
 the things I'm made up of
     F                       C
 the leaves are tied up on my arms

[Instrumental]
Am  G C F C (C/B)

[Bridge]
Am                                             Em
 And I miss that comfort in being trusted by the king and the princess
    Em
the king and the princess
the king and the princess
the king and the princess
the lights and the flashes

[Verse]
        Am                             Em
I might float for a second through the shadows of my reason
       Am                           Em
For my own, my own children, on the rainbow above the ocean
        Am                              Em
I might float for a second through the shadows of my reason
       Am                          Em
For my own, my own children on the rainbow above the ocean
Am
 (There is something in the weather coming.
         Em
It's the spring time floating on upon the city..)
        Am                             Em
I might float for a second through the shadows of my reason
       Am                           Em
For my own, my own children, on the rainbow above the ocean</pre>
