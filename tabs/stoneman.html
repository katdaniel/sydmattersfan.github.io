[Verse]
G#           Cm
Green is arguing with yellow
G#        Cm
In a submarine beneath the flow
G#            Cm
Far from the electric lives
G#               Cm
Fighting with my midnight knives


[Pre-Chorus]
      G#          Cm
And I wonder if I could have known
  G#             Cm     C#                   A#m   C#m
I wonder if they drown, swilling down in the ocean

Feeding in the water


[Chorus]
       G#            Cm    G#              Cm
I have heard about a fable once when I was young
        G#        Cm      G#        Cm
About a man being able to turn into stone
         C#             A#m
But I've never been a believer
      C#m
And I never will

[Verse]
G#               Cm
Give up all your dreams
G#             Cm
Don't let them grow
G#              Cm
Throw away your wishes
G#              Cm
No you'll never know
C#            A#m
Cut them into pieces
C#m            G#
Burn them in a row


[Chorus]

[Outro]
G#
I feel like a rock now
Cm
Like a stone man
G#
Nothing's gonna break me
Cm
Nothing's gonna change them
