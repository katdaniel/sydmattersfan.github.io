[Verse 1]
D
Danny found these vile creatures
                         G
In the deep place of the room
                            F#
They said we don't have any feathers
                    Bm
We haven't even got bones


[Verse 2]
D
Danny turned them into dishes
                   G
It didn't take too long
                        F#
'Coz they were all like fishes
                     Bm
They didn't even got bones


[Chorus]
      Em
Where have you been?
      Bm
I forgot anyway
     Em              F#
What have you seen today?


[Verse 3]
D
He's going down every summer
                        G
He's making a trip underground
                           F#
Hurry up to share with his brother
                   Bm
All the secrets he found


[Verse 4]
D
Never afraid of getting further
                   G
Danny discovered a town
                           F#
He wanted to talk with the Queen mother
                   Bm
Now he's wearing a crown


[Chorus]
      Em
Where have you been?
      Bm
I forgot anyway
     Em              F#
What have you seen today?
